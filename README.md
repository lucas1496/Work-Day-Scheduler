This repository contains all the files related to my Work Day Scheduler application assignment.

## What does this application do?

- This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to store events/information for each hour of the day between 9am and 5pm. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The implementation of the Moment.js library is also essential in order for the page to display the current time, and for its color scheme to be updated according to the current time of the day.
